22 Short Films About Springfield" is the twenty first episode of The Simpsons' seventh season, which originally aired on April 14, 1996. It was written by Richard Appel, David S. Cohen, Jonathan Collier, Jennifer Crittenden, Greg Daniels, Brent Forrester, Rachel Pulido, Steve Tompkins, Josh Weinstein, Bill Oakley and Matt Groening, with the writing being supervised by Greg Daniels. The episode was directed by Jim Reardon. Phil Hartman guest starred as Lionel Hutz and the hospital board chairman. The episode looks into the lives of other Springfield residents in a series of linked stories and originated from the end segment of the season four episode "The Front". The episode is a loose parody of Pulp Fiction, which gave the staff the idea of a possible spin off from The Simpsons. The title is a reference to the film Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould.

A Fish Called Selma" is the nineteenth episode of The Simpsons' seventh season and originally aired on March 24, 1996. The episode sees Troy McClure attempt to resurrect his acting career by marrying Selma Bouvier. Show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were fans of Phil Hartman and wished to produce an episode which focused on his character McClure. Freelance writer Jack Barth wrote the episode, and Mark Kirkland directed it. Barth's script underwent a substantial rewrite in the show's writing room, including the expansion of the Planet of the Apes musical and addition of the song "Dr. Zaius". The episode ran too long because of the slow pace of Troy and Selma's speech. Consequently, guest star Jeff Goldblum rerecorded his dialogue as MacArthur Parker at a faster speed. The episode received generally positive reviews, with particular praise given to Hartman and the musical. Entertainment Weekly placed the episode eighth on their list of the top 25 The Simpsons episodes.	[(abstract,(20), A_Fish_Called_Selma)]

A Star Is Born Again" is the 13th episode from The Simpsons' fourteenth season, which first aired on March 2, 2003. The episode owes much of its plot to Notting Hill (1999). While that film is about an actress finding happiness with the owner of an independent bookstore, the Simpsons episode features Hollywood movie star Sara Sloane falling for Ned Flanders after visiting the Leftorium. This is the only Simpsons episode in which the same person has been accredited with two different names, where James L. Brooks is credited as the Executive Producer and Executive Creative Consultant, and again as Jim Brooks as a Special Guest Voice.	[(abstract,(17), A_Star_Is_Born_Again)]

A Star Is Burns" is the eighteenth episode of The Simpsons' sixth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 5, 1995. In the episode, Springfield decides to hold a film festival, and famed critic Jay Sherman is invited to be a judge. Homer, feeling that Marge does not respect him, asks that he be put on the jury panel and ends up voting for the stupidest movie. The story involves a crossover with the short lived animated series The Critic. Jay Sherman was the main character on the show. The Critic was created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had previously written for The Simpsons but left following the fourth season, and produced by James L. Brooks, who was also a producer for The Simpsons. The show had premiered on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) network in January 1994 but was canceled despite positive critical reception. The series was switched over to Fox, and put in the timeslot directly after The Simpsons. Brooks pitched a crossover episode as a way to promote The Critic and decided that a film festival would be a good way to introduce Sherman. Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, reacted negatively when he heard about this episode, feeling that it was just an advertisement for The Critic, and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the program pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode "violates the Simpsons' universe. " In response, Brooks said "I am furious with Matt, [... ... ] he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far. [... ... ] his behavior right now is rotten. " The episode was directed by Susie Dietter and was the first episode to be written by Ken Keeler. Jon Lovitz, the star of The Critic, guest stars as Jay Sherman, while Maurice LaMarche (who was also a regular on The Critic) has a few minor roles. Sherman later became an infrequently recurring character on The Simpsons. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom felt the crossover was out of place on the show although Barney's film festival entry was well received.

The two reasons I am opposed to this crossover is that I don't want any credit or blame for The Critic and I feel this  violates the Simpsons' universe, The Critic has nothing to do with the Simpsons' world. ... I'm not criticizing The Critic. But cartoons have their own style and I really have nothing to say about The Critic. Through all the years of The Simpsons we have been careful about maintaining their uniqueness. Sure, there have been other cartoons who visit, but it's usually just one scene, often for a sight gag.
